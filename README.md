# Assignment-Project-3

My idea for this project might be somewhat disimilar from the programs we've practiced with in class but this comes moreso from a personal interest. I was thinking of making a menu like the one I did in Project 1 that opens 2-3 simple games to play. Ones that are reasonable to complete given this assignment. For example, one of them could be a simple game of snake. These should follow all the rules outlined of implementing a JavaFX GUI, making use of file I/O, having multiple classes, unit tests, and exception handling.
